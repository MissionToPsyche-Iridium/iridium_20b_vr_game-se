 # PSYCHE SCRAPER

## Arizona State University
### Developed by Team 33: Kevin Nangcas, Shannon Ray, Erik Sousa, Chad Valente. 


## Project Description

Psyche Scraper is a Virtual Reality space game that is based off of an existing 2D web game, “Return to Psyche.” These games are inspired by NASA’s Psyche mission, which aims to study the metal-rich asteroid, Psyche 16. Psyche is one of the largest asteroids in the solar system and studying it can reveal vital information about the core of our Earth, as it is believed to have survived multiple collisions that took place during the formation of our solar system. In October of 2023, NASA launched a spacecraft, also named “Psyche”, to the asteroid to study it more closely. Team 33 created the Psyche Scraper Virtual Reality experience with the goal of educating its players on NASA’s mission researching and traveling to Psyche. 

Psyche Scraper is tailored for event settings, featuring an “Event Mode” designed for players of all ages. This mode offers a three-minute gameplay session, providing a complete VR experience while keeping wait times between players minimal. The experience engages the public and raises awareness about NASA’s Psyche mission by immersing players in an interactive journey inspired by the asteroids exploration.
